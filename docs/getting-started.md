IDendro helps you create nicer, interactive visualizations of hierarchical clustering trees (a.k.a. dendrograms) in your preferred python visualization library. It does not include any clustering functionality itself, but integrates with SciPy and Scikit-Learn hierarchical clustering outputs instead. HDBScan is not supported at this stage.

Backends currently supported: Altair, Matplotlib, Plotly and Streamlit (with a custom D3 component).
